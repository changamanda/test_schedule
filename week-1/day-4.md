## Notes

Friday is going to be a day to catchup on all of this, we'll only introduce blocks and yields, basic variable scope, some higher level enumerators, so not much. You're going to get a bunch of homework for the weekend to build your first few Command Line Interfaces (CLIs).

Learn is filled with content and labs at this point. It should flow pretty linearly and you should read and do the labs in the progression. Get as far as you can.
