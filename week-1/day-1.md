Try to get XCode and XCode Command Line Tools installed, depending on your OS version and your XCode version, the instructions are a little different.

Try these resources:

[RailsApps Installing Ruby on OSX](http://railsapps.github.io/installrubyonrails-mac.html)

[InstallRails](http://installrails.com/)

If you can go into terminal and type: gcc and get anything besides `-bash: gcc: command not found` you're good.

Ultimately we'll deal with most of the environment setup tomorrow but we use a RVM based setup with Homebrew for Package manager.


## Prepare For (Read and Try but Don't Stress)
