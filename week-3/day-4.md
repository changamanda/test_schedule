## Re: The ActiveRecord Reading

Soon we are going to start using ActiveRecord, which is an ORM. Definitely read the [ActiveRecord Basics Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/active_record_basics.html), particularly the first 3 sections. The [Migration Guide](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/migrations.html) is absolutely crucial as it is how we create schema for our database in ActiveRecord (which is the crux of a future todo).

## Labs

* Continue working on the SQL/ORM labs!
