## Homework

Complete the [Ironboard Tutorial](http://learn.flatironschool.com/learn/ruby-007/web-development/ironboard-tutorial/using-ironboard/the-first-lab)

[Install XCode](http://learn.flatironschool.com/learn/ruby-007/web-development/environment/setup/installing-xcode)

[Organize Your Profile Content](https://gist.github.com/aviflombaum/f805712031c3d21e2b7d)

Try to get XCode and XCode Command Line Tools installed, depending on your OS version and your XCode version, the instructions are a little different.

Try these resources:

[RailsApps Installing Ruby on OSX](http://railsapps.github.io/installrubyonrails-mac.html)

[InstallRails](http://installrails.com/)

If you can go into terminal and type: gcc and get anything besides `-bash: gcc: command not found` you're good.

Ultimately we'll deal with most of the environment setup tomorrow but we use a RVM based setup with Homebrew for Package manager.
